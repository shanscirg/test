  <h2>All About Amy</h2>

    <p>Amy Winehouse was born in London, England in 1983. She began her career at age 16 as a jazz vocalist.
      Her music went on to be described as "an eclectic mix of jazz, pop, soul and R&B" 
      (<a href="https://www.biography.com/musician/amy-winehouse" target="_blank">biography.com</a>). 
      Her 2006 album <em>Back to Black</em> earned her five Grammy Awards and major attention from the masses.
      Over the following few years, Amy performed with top artists like The Rolling Stones, Prince, Adele, and Tony Bennett. 
      Her tremendous talent and fame earned her a spot on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music list and another Grammy
      for her performance with Tony Bennett. Heartbreakingly, Amy passed away at age 27 in 2011 due to 
      accidental alcohol poisoning. Her legacy continues through her music and recent documentary on her 
      life, <em>Amy</em>, by Asif Kapadia (2016).
